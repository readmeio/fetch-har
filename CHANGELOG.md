## 8.0.0 (2022-04-28)

> **BREAKING CHANGE**
>
> This library is now written in TypeScript and as a result the main export dist is now contained within a `default` object. If you load it into your codebase with `import` you don't need to do anything, but if you're using `require()` you'll need to do `require('fetch-har').default`.
